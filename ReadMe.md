# Ansible automation for Windows

## Overview
Ansible is an open-source product that automates provisioning (virtual machines, containers, and network and complete cloud infrastructures), configuration management, and application deployments. In addition, Ansible allows you to automate the deployment and configuration of resources in your environment. It acts like an orchestrator/maestro - one server to manage others and unify different configurations and processes.
